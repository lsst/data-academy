# Rubin Data Academy 2025

Mon Jun 30 to Thu Jul 3

Virtual

This year's Academy week is designed to provide a basic introduction to both the Rubin Science Platform's tools and the Data Preview 1 data release. Ten unique sessions will be run. Each session will occur at least twice. Two sessions will be run in parallel, mornings and evenings (US Pacific) for access from global timezones.

No registration is required to attend, but attendees **must** set up their [Rubin Science Platform accounts](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/getting-started/get-an-account.html) in advance.

Join the Zoom: [ls.st/cst-zoom](https://ls.st/cst-zoom)

## Sessions, slides, and recordings.

Sessions: This year, all sessions are being run with the tutorials for Data Preview 1 (DP1), which can be found in the DP1 documentation at [dp1.lsst.io](https://dp1.lsst.io/index.html).

Slides: Links to all slide decks are view-only. Most sessions have very limited slides as most of the time will be spent in hands-on demonstrations with the RSP.

Recordings: The first instance of every session will be recorded. Recordings will be available for 30 days.

### 1. Get started with the RSP
Step-by-step instructions to get an account in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) at data.lsst.cloud. Learn how to execute a Jupyter Notebook and discover data via the Portal. Access the RSP's documentation and learn where to ask for help. This session is for those who have never used the RSP before or could use a refresher.
